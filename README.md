#Hidebar

Dynamically hides reddit sidebar to prevent it from covering up content



Tired of content being covered up by the sidebar when you browse Reddit in the split-screen?
This lightweight Chrome extension built using JavaScript and JQuery hides the sidebar when you decrease the width of your window so that you can view content.
